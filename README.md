### Project Overview

In this project, I've built an Excel dashboard to analyze sales of a coffee shop. In this project, I've done some basic data cleaning and preprocessing to analyze the data and draw insights from it via the dashboards. I'm keenly interested in data visualization, so in this project, I've tried to work on my dashboarding skills and explore how meaningful insights can be presented through dashboards.

### Major steps followed

1. Data cleaning and preprocessing.
2. Cross-referencing the tables to get the desired information through lookups
3. Deriving required columns (like 'total sales' = unit price x quantity).
4. Creating pivot tables for analyzing the cleaned data.
5. Adding appropriate visuals (like a bar chart, column chart, donut chart etc.) for those pivot tables.
6. Adding slicers to slice and dice the data as required.
7. Collating all the visuals and presenting them together in the dashboard.
8. Formatting of the dashboard and the visuals.

### Insights and Findings

1. Sales spike up during the initial 2 months (Jan, Feb) of the year on account of the new year and Christmas holidays.
2. Almost 80%-90% of the sales come from the United States.
3. Liberica and Excelsa are equally preferred by the customers.

### Recommendations and further scope

- I've used a limited number of visuals in this dashboard. Some other visuals can also be explored which can be used to present in the dashboard.
- KPI cards can be used to present key parameters on the dashboard.
- Insights can also be drawn based on the roast type preferred by customers, and the contribution of sales from loyalty card holders, to target and attract more customers under the loyalty schemes.
